This *cursorword* plugin underlines the word under the cursor. That's it.

While we are coding, we always pay attention to the variable under the cursor.
Where did we define the variable? In which statement do we use the variable?
Searching the variable using |star| or |#| is a simple solution to highlight all
the places the variable is used. However, it costs too much time to highlight
a word, move around to check the places and clear the highlight.  This plugin
|cursorword| provides you the modest underlines for the variables under the
cursor to let you know all the places the variable is used at a glance without
stopping coding.
